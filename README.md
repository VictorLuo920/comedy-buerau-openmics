# The Comedy Bureau App: The Open Mics SignUp Sheet

### App Description

Honestly, this app is meant to be a labor of love. 

I found the Comedy Bureau Website late 2019 and found it an immensely useful resource to leaping into the rich comedy scene in Los Angeles. However, I was dismayed at the level of web technology being deployed at this level, so I decided to do something about it. 

Appifying the comedy bureau website to make it a user-centric app where users can not only view events, but save them to ther profile and make comments, a tracker for the aspiring standup comic. Currently consuming ticketmaster API as proof of concept 

### Technologies Used
React, Express, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose


### Future Plans
* This was a really tough challenge, and I would definitely like to refactor this from the ground up with real data and better ERD from the beginning.
* UX is terrible. I'm sorry. I don't know why it's so buggy anymore. I will get better at front-end eventually.
