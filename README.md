# The Comedy Bureau App: The Open Mics SignUp Sheet

## App Description

Honestly, this app is meant to be a labor of love. 

I found the Comedy Bureau Website late 2019 and found it an immensely useful resource to leaping into the vibrant comedy scene in Los Angeles. However, I was shocked this rich resource limited its features to simply being a reference. Many comedy venues rely on either analog pen-and-paper tools or third-party web solutions to handle open-mic sign ups. With the Coemedy Buereau doing such a good job being a central location to see where there are open mics across the city, my hopes is that upgradinfg the resource with functionalities to handle open-mic sign ups could create unprecedented shifts in the way the comedy scene engages with its performers.

## Technologies Used
React, Express, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose

## Problems I'm Solving
* The open mic comedy relies on a disjointed set of services for both promotions and operations
* A rich resource already that already exists, The Comedy Bureau, is severely underutilized in its potential

## Advantages
* A single-source app that documents all open mic events and handles sign-ups puts more power back into the people who make comedy their living
* Standardaizing a web tech solution that doesn't yet exist in this niche market will offer unseen opportunities for growth and user engagement

## Solutions
* Users will be able to see the list of venues offering open mic events (to add later, API exists, have not incorporated)
* Users will be able to see the details of those open mic events and slot themselves in.
* Admin users will be able to manage events on their end (feature not yet implemented)

## Future Plans
* Fully adapting the original website, which is currently hosted on Wordpress, to run as a full-stack web and mobile application
